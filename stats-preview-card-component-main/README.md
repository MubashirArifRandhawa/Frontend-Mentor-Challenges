# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

Completed the challenge in approx 1 hr

Added the breakpoints at 640px

I tried to make it responsive to the best of my knowledge

Used both Flex box and Grid

Also learnt how to layer the background onto image by single color like purple in this case
