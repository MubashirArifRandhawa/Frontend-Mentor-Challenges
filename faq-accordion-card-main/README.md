### What I learned

#### Details tag

this tag is pre-built and is perfect for FAQ design, you can also check this tag. ![MDN Web Docs Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details). It has a generic arrow so I saw this solution ![Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10813581/replace-the-expand-icon-of-html5-details-tag) on Stack overflow to change the arrow to whatever you want.
